# Only Events

OnlyEvents is an events website based on a social media model. 
The purpose of the website is to acknowledge users of events, which they can filter according to their tastes.
The website also helps users socialize through a commenting section that enables them to schedule meet-ups before an event.
Users can show interest and attendance to events, comment and like others' comments, and post pictures relative to the events. 
Users can only post pictures on the event page, not on their profile page, as this is not a social media that aims to promote individuals but only events, and they can not like pictures since the purpose of the website is not to encourage or discourage to post photos in base on other users' likes.

#### User stories progress

### Structure
The website has been organized in a hierarchical tree structure for the user to navigate the site intuitively.

![Only Events website map](readme-images/tree.png)

### Design planning:
The design of the website has been implemented using Balsamiq wireframes. The wireframes allowed me to sketch prototypes of the web pages so that I had a clear visual idea of how the website should have looked like.

**Home Page**

**Profile Page**

**Event Page**

**Categories Page**

**Add event form**

**Add photo form**

### Design choices

#### Color scheme
Due to the versatility of the website, which can display sports events as well as yoga events, art events, or classical music events, finding the appropriate color has revealed a challenging task. The final decision was a gradient of purple tones, which according to color psychology, also represents imagination and creativity and looks quite popular amongst events websites.
The colors were taken from [Color Adobe](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel), using the Analogous option.

![Only Events colors](readme-images/colors.png)

#### Typography
The font used for the navigation bar is Poiret One: a geometric font that also appears delicate and attractive.
Across the site, the font used is Montserrat. This
typeface achieves high legibility even in small sizes and perpetrates the modern vibes of the website.
The pairing was taken from the pairing section of [Fontpair](https://www.fontpair.co/all).
